It's that time of the year again to do a little personal retrospective.

2016 passed by so quickly! I had a fantastic time playing around with (and taking care of) my wife and daughter. It's really astonishing to see how much a baby can learn and grow in a year.

Being a father also helps putting things into perspective and rediscover the little pleasures in live. For example, there is literally no better cure for stress than coming home, being greeted by a happy smile and laying down on the floor playing with your own kid. :)

Besides that, I actually found more time than expected to grow technically. As such I:

- Wrote [11 blogposts](http://jeroenmols.com/blog/), almost meeting my goal of 1 per month
- Got featured in [Android weekly](http://androidweekly.net/search?keyword=jeroen+mols&commit=Search) a whopping 9 times
- Appeared on [Android dialogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxFaWXkBo2E)
- Spoke at 5 big conferences + 1 local meetup
- Grew my [twitter](https://twitter.com/molsjeroen) followers to more than 750
- Gathered over 1000 stars on [Github](http://github-awards.com/users/search?login=jeroenmols)
- Gained >2000 reputation on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2771851/jmols)
- Built a new Github library [MockitoCollectionMatchers](https://github.com/JeroenMols/MockitoCollectionMatchers)
- Visited Google IO (finally!)
- Built 2 green field side projects!
- Made plans for building a house
- Taught my daughter how to fist bump and say Yolo #awesomedad

Next year construction of our dream house will start, so time will once again be a scarce resource. And since I don't want to give in on quality time with my daughter, I'll just try to keep up my current blogging and speaking efforts. However, it would be really cool if I could speak at a conference outside Europe!
