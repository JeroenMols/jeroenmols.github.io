   <title>Removing all trackers from my website</title>
   <link href="https://jeroenmols.com/blog/2023/01/29/remove-trackers/"/>
   <updated>2023-01-29T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>https://jeroenmols.com/blog/2023/01/29/remove-trackers</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[
     
     <p>These past years I’ve grown to be more privacy-aware. And while this post isn’t about how I’m increasing my personal privacy, I’d like to talk about how I’m increasing yours.</p>

<p>My website had three services integrated:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/#/provision">Google Analytics</a> gave me insights into how much people read my content and what topics were popular to write about.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/start/">Google Adsense</a> showed ads underneath every blog post and enabled me to monetize my content. With this I received two payments (70.84 euro in 2019 and 74.20 euro in 2020), covering the expenses for my domain name for about 14 years.</li>
  <li><a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus comments</a> allowed people to comment on my content, but since I didn’t pay for the service Disqus was also serving advertisements.</li>
</ul>

<p>And while these services were adding some value to my website, they were doing so at the cost of your privacy. By default (!!!), they not only track your interaction with my website, but also detailed information about you (gender, age, approximate location,…) and they even track you across different websites.</p>

<p>But should I really be collecting all that data about you?</p>

<p>Should I really hand off all that data to those services?</p>

<p>Have I ever asked your consent about any of this?</p>

<p>Well, I no longer believe it is “normal” for websites or products to engage in these practices. That every experience needs to be personalized. Or that we should give away our privacy so easily.</p>

<p>Therefore I’ve decided to strip all such services. Now my website is a safe space where you can enjoy (hopefully) my content without worrying about advertisements or tracker blockers.</p>

<p>However, I do still care about your opinion!</p>

<p>So moving forward you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Let me know you’ve read this by liking one of my social posts</li>
  <li>Talk about my content on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> or <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a></li>
  <li>Send me feedback/questions on <a href="https://androiddev.social/@Jeroenmols">Mastodon</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You’re in full control whether you decide to reach out or not!</p>

<p>I’ll keep doing my best to provide you with interesting content (which is a ton of work) and hence appreciate every single like or shoutout.</p>

   <title>Year in review 2020</title>
   <link href="https://jeroenmols.com/blog/2021/01/05/yearinreview/"/>
   <updated>2021-01-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>https://jeroenmols.com/blog/2021/01/05/yearinreview</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[
     
     <p>Well… I don’t really know where to start this time. 2020 was quite the rollercoaster, with many downs… but fortunately also a few amazing ups. Let’s focus on the good stuff.</p>

<p>My first lucky break was that I started working remotely by choice! This privilege meant I was quite well equipped both practically and mentally for the challenges of remote work. And while not without its challenges, I haven’t been happier at my work.</p>

<p>The main work challenge was bridging the 9-hour timezone gap with my colleagues. And while I do work some evenings, I’ve never been more available for my kids. And I’ve grown really fond of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>never (!!!) having to set an alarm clock</li>
  <li>exercising in the middle of a working day</li>
  <li>grabbing coffee/breakfast with my wife anytime I want (can?)</li>
</ul>

<p>Another highlight was the amazing time I was able to spend with my kids during the first Lockdown. I would work from 2pm to 10pm so me and the kids could do fun stuff in the mornings (fixing up the house, gardening, playgrounds,…). I recognize how extraordinary it was to have so much playtime with my kids and truly enjoyed it.</p>

<p>However, working such long days also meant I pushed myself beyond my limits and I had to take it a lot slower for several weeks before I felt better. A huge shoutout to Plaid and my manager Judd for the immense understanding they’ve shown for my situation.</p>

<p>Further, I’ve also built and designed my own custom Lego set: <a href="http://bit.ly/legostuntcar">Radio-Controlled Flip Over Stunt Car</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/legostuntcar"><img src="https://jeroenmols.com/img/blog/yearinreview20/lego-ideas.jpg" alt="Radio-Controlled Flip Over Stunt Car" class="align-center" /></a></p>

<p>Please give me a <a href="http://bit.ly/legostuntcar">vote</a>!!! If I make it to 10k supporters, Lego might actually make it into an official set. 🤞</p>

<p>Further 2020 highlights include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>🧱 Teaching my son and daughter how to build Lego</li>
  <li>👨‍💻 Spoke at <a href="https://jeroenmols.com/speaking/">4 online events</a> and produced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCKb1WfjAC8">1 video</a>.</li>
  <li>📝 Wrote <a href="http://jeroenmols.com/blog/">6 blog posts</a></li>
  <li>📱 Grew my <a href="https://twitter.com/molsjeroen">Twitter</a> followers by ~20% to more than 7500</li>
  <li>🦠 Contributed code to the official <a href="https://github.com/nhsx/covid-19-app-android-ag-public/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/jeroenmols">UK Covid app</a></li>
  <li>🚗 Drove less than 1500 km with my car (down from 30k km)</li>
  <li>☕️  Improved my coffee skills with (basic) latte art!</li>
  <li>🚴‍♀️ Worked out (almost) biweekly on my indoor racing bike</li>
  <li>🪒 Shaved my hair and grew a beard</li>
  <li>📕 Read 4 books</li>
  <li>📈 Started investing</li>
</ul>

<p>To keep the best for last: we’re expecting a baby girl in March! 🍼👼</p>

<p>In 2021, I’m going to try and exercise twice a week, read 5 books, enjoy every little moment with the baby and double down on being an awesome father for all my kids.</p>

<p>I do want to pick up my community contributions again and maybe even venture into other areas beyond Android.</p>

     <p>Getting up without being rushed, cycling my kids to school, cooking healthy salads for lunch, kids running into my arms when they get home… I’m quite happy with my new daily routine!</p>

<p>Without a doubt, 2019 was the highlight of my career!</p>

<ul>
  <li>At Philips Hue, we quadrupled (!!! 🚀) our team output and increased our app rating to 4.4 stars (up from 2.8 stars).</li>
  <li>After a year of searching, I transitioned to remote work to spend more time with my kids.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, not everything went according to plan: my new employer ran out of money and I found myself unemployed for the very first time in my life.</p>

<p>This caused quite a bit of anxiety and stress for my wife and I, especially given our mortgage and two kids…</p>

<p>And then something amazing happened:</p>

<p>I reached out for help on twitter and the response was so overwhelming…  it really moved us.</p>

<p>So thanks to everyone for sharing the message, providing leads and support! 🙇‍</p>

<p>While all those job interviews were quite demanding, I ended up finding a stellar freelance gig at TransferWise and a very exciting new position at Plaid. I’m stoked to share more about those on my blog later this year.</p>

<p>Further 2019 highlights include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Teaching my daughter how to cycle and my son to tell his mother “I love you”</li>
  <li>Spoke at <a href="https://jeroenmols.com/speaking/">5 big conferences</a> and 2 meetups.</li>
  <li>Wrote <a href="http://jeroenmols.com/blog/">14 blog posts</a>, including two quite ambitious in-depth series</li>
  <li>Gave my first <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jeroenmols/inclusive-communication">talk on inclusion</a> at the GDE summit</li>
  <li>Open-sourced two <a href="https://github.com/JeroenMols">sample apps</a> on Github</li>
  <li>Wrote an <a href="/blog/2019/08/06/lessonsleaddeveloper/">honest, self critical retrospective</a> on my experiences leading the team at Philips Hue</li>
  <li>Doubled my <a href="https://twitter.com/molsjeroen">Twitter</a> followers to more than 6300</li>
  <li>Got featured a whopping 11 times in <a href="http://androidweekly.net/search?keyword=jeroen+mols&amp;commit=Search">Android weekly</a></li>
  <li>Started working remotely</li>
  <li>Took many steps to reduce my impact on the environment: cycle more, remote work, carry reusable cup, avoid single-use items,…</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://jeroenmols.com/img/blog/yearinreview19/cargobike.jpg" alt="Cycling kids to school" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>In 2020, I’m going to focus on living a healthier lifestyle: exercise more, eat healthier and get better sleep. Further, I want to continue enjoying the little things in life and do silly stuff with my kids.</p>

<p>I don’t plan on increasing my community contributions, in fact, I might even do slightly less. However, I would also like to explore alternative ways to give back such as one-on-one mentoring or speaking at a remote conference.</p>

     <p>Three years ago, we decided ramp up internal app development at Philips Hue. After interviewing candidates (78!) for six months, I became the lead Android developer of the freshly hired Android team.</p>

<p>In this non-tech post (for a change), I’d like to openly share my experiences being a team lead. It’s been a bumpy ride, but I came out with quite some new perspectives that make me a stronger lead and a better person.</p>

<h1 id="part-1-team-and-project">Part 1: Team and project</h1>
<p>To put my experiences into perspective, I think it’s important to first cover the team set up, my role and some of the project history.</p>

     <p>From Android Q onwards devices can now operate in a fully gestural system navigation mode. In that mode, there is no longer an on-screen back button, instead users can swipe from both edges to navigate back.</p>

<p>In this blog post, we’ll look at a case study on how we added support for these back gestures in the Philips Hue app.</p>

   <title>Year in review 2018</title>
   <link href="https://jeroenmols.com/blog/2019/01/01/yearinreview/"/>

   <id>https://jeroenmols.com/blog/2019/01/01/yearinreview</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[
     
     <p>Sitting in our own couch, in our own house, kids safely asleep upstairs,… The road here was brutal, but the result is extraordinary.</p>

<p>The past year was (hopefully) the busiest year of my entire life. In the midst of raising two amazing kids, a challenging full-time job and being an active GDE, we built our dream house!</p>

<p>Looking back I honestly don’t know how we managed to pull all of this off… Choosing everything for the house, selecting and planning all contractors and even doing some (a lot more than anticipated) work myself… Anyways, I won’t bother you with the details, but if not for my wife and kids I would have broken down completely. The goal justifies the means.</p>

<p>Also at work, it was a non-trivial and very demanding year. I used to pride myself for being great at keeping a work-life balance, but… being a responsible for a team of people can really be quite intense.</p>

<p>Our team had quite some challenges thrown at us, and we really made the best of it: sometimes massively successful, but we also struggled… All in all, we did get a tight grip on our regression, laid the groundwork to improve our architecture and migrated to continuous deployment. (talk coming 2019 ;) )</p>

<p>In 2018, I/we mostly invested in our family’s future and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Built and moved into our dream house</li>
  <li>Helped our daughter go to school and taught our son how to walk</li>
  <li>Spoke at <a href="https://jeroenmols.com/speaking/">4 big conferences</a> and 1 meetup.</li>
  <li>Wrote <a href="http://jeroenmols.com/blog/">9 blog posts</a>, not making my goal of 1 per month</li>
  <li>Almost double my <a href="https://twitter.com/molsjeroen">Twitter</a> followers to more than 3620</li>
  <li>Got 6 times featured in <a href="http://androidweekly.net/search?keyword=jeroen+mols&amp;commit=Search">Android weekly</a> and several times in <a href="http://mailchi.mp/kotlinweekly/kotlin-weekly-118">Kotlin weekly</a></li>
  <li>Exclusively used Kotlin for every blog post and slide deck</li>
  <li>Helped Pluralsight built a <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/score/skill-assessment/kotlin-app-fundamentals/intro?context=skills#/v2/landing">Kotlin: App Fundamentals</a> assessment</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://jeroenmols.com/img/blog/yearinreview18/christmas_tree.jpg" alt="Garden view" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>Looking forward to next year, I’m planning on living more! I’ve bought quite a few Lego’s I’d like to build, want to bring my kids to school by bike, spend more quality time with my wife and just professionally waste time on occasion. :)</p>

<p>I’m going to try and increase my community efforts back to 2017 level and maybe experiment with some new formats, such as <a href="https://jeroenmols.com/blog/2018/12/06/fixthetest/">my last blog post</a>.</p>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[
     
     <p>Refactoring can be tedious and easily introduce bugs. The main reason for this is the number of manual steps involved: rename, move, copy-paste,… So wouldn’t it make sense to automate this and have Android Studio do all the work for you?</p>

<p>This post will zoom in on the most useful refactoring options of Android Studio. Enabling you to refactor more confidently, introduce fewer bugs and increase overall quality as also variables, documentation, etc. will be updated.</p>

   <title>Year in review 2017</title>
   <link href="https://jeroenmols.com/blog/2018/01/01/yearinreview/"/>
   <updated>2018-01-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>https://jeroenmols.com/blog/2018/01/01/yearinreview</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[
     
     <p>For the first time ever I have my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">year in review</code> ready in time.</p>

<p>I’m sure I’ll never forget 2017. Not only did we start building our dream house, but more importantly, our family grew to 4 people! Our baby girl Lene - ahum Toddler - became the big sister of our newborn son Wout. While having two kids is definitely very, very intense, it’s extraordinary to see them grow and a privilege to experience how fond they already are of each other.</p>

<p>For my career this was the most remarkable year so far as I:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Became a <a href="https://developers.google.com/experts/people/jeroen-mols">Google Developer Expert for Android</a></li>
  <li>Built up an internal app team and became the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6264882628466475008">Lead Android developer</a> at Philips Hue</li>
  <li>Started my own company <a href="https://jeroenmols.com/hireme/">Build IT bvba</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Further, I’m super proud of all my community efforts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spoke at <a href="https://jeroenmols.com/speaking/">4 big conferences + 5 local meetups</a></li>
  <li>Wrote <a href="http://jeroenmols.com/blog/">13 blog posts</a>, exceeding my goal of 1 per month</li>
  <li>Grew my <a href="https://twitter.com/molsjeroen">Twitter</a> followers to more than 1850</li>
  <li>Had the <a href="https://medium.com/@jordanjoz/12-android-blogs-you-should-be-following-1220c7e5398d">12th most influential Android blog</a> in the world</li>
  <li>Got 5 times featured in <a href="http://androidweekly.net/search?keyword=jeroen+mols&amp;commit=Search">Android weekly</a> and once in <a href="http://mailchi.mp/kotlinweekly/kotlin-weekly-59">Kotlin weekly</a></li>
  <li>Gave the <a href="https://devoxx.be/2017/11/the-top-100-rated-devoxx-belgium-2017-talks/">8th highest rated talk</a> at Devoxx</li>
  <li>Revamped <a href="https://jeroenmols.com/">my website</a> with https, faster loading, and search</li>
</ul>

<p>But leave no mistake, my family is and will always be the most important thing in the world!</p>

<p><img src="https://jeroenmols.com/img/blog/yearinreview17/house.jpg" alt="Status of our house" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>Looking forward to next year, stuff is going to be intense for sure! We’ll complete the construction of our house, our daughter will start going to school, our son will likely learn how to walk,… and I don’t want to miss a second of all that. Which means #latenightblogging. :)</p>

<p>So I’m not going to increase my community efforts, but instead, I’d like to experiment with data analytics to increase the impact of all my typical efforts.</p>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[
     
     <p>It’s that time of the year again to do a little personal retrospective.</p>

<p>2016 passed by so quickly! I had a fantastic time playing around with (and taking care of) my wife and daughter. It’s really astonishing to see how much a baby can learn and grow in a year.</p>

<p>Being a father also helps putting things into perspective and rediscover the little pleasures in live. For example, there is literally no better cure for stress than coming home, being greeted by a happy smile and laying down on the floor playing with your own kid. :)</p>

<p>Besides that, I actually found more time than expected to grow technically. As such I:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wrote <a href="http://jeroenmols.com/blog/">11 blogposts</a>, almost meeting my goal of 1 per month</li>
  <li>Got featured in <a href="http://androidweekly.net/search?keyword=jeroen+mols&amp;commit=Search">Android weekly</a> a whopping 9 times</li>
  <li>Appeared on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxFaWXkBo2E">Android dialogs</a></li>
  <li>Spoke at 5 big conferences + 1 local meetup</li>
  <li>Grew my <a href="https://twitter.com/molsjeroen">twitter</a> followers to more than 750</li>
  <li>Gathered over 1000 stars on <a href="http://github-awards.com/users/search?login=jeroenmols">Github</a></li>
  <li>Gained &gt;2000 reputation on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/2771851/jmols">stackoverflow</a></li>
  <li>Built a new Github library <a href="https://github.com/JeroenMols/MockitoCollectionMatchers">MockitoCollectionMatchers</a></li>
  <li>Visited Google IO (finally!)</li>
  <li>Built 2 green field side projects!</li>
  <li>Made plans for building a house</li>
  <li>Taught my daughter how to fist bump and say Yolo #awesomedad</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://jeroenmols.com/img/blog/yearinreview16/house.png" alt="Render of our house" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>Next year construction of our dream house will start, so time will once again be a scarce resource. And since I don’t want to give in on quality time with my daughter, I’ll just try to keep up my current blogging and speaking efforts. However, it would be really cool if I could speak at a conference outside Europe!</p>

     <p>Code coverage is an awesome way to motivate you and your team to write more tests. But did you know that simply enabling it slows down your build significantly?</p>

<p>This blogpost will detail why and offer an easy solution.</p>

     <p>As die hard Android developers, copyright notices are usually not on top of our priority list. Yet large corporations always insist to add a copyright header. Why do they do that? Should you do that for your open source libraries?</p>

<p>This blog post will explain what copyright is and why it’s so important. Further it’ll also show how to easily add/update copyright notices to your code base.</p>

   <title>Turn Android into an awesome cycling GPS</title>

     <p>Cycling is all about exploring: visiting new places and making existing routes more fun with better streets. So there must be an app that allows to plan your route and start cycling right? Think again… there is currently no solution that offers turn by turn navigation for cyclists.</p>

<p>As I had an old Android device laying around, I decided to repurpose that and convert it into a GPS that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tracks my activity</li>
  <li>imports gpx tracks created on my computer</li>
  <li>offers turn by turn navigation (screen + voice)</li>
</ul>

<p>This blogpost will detail how I use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand">OsmAnd</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.dropsync">Dropsync</a> to create new tracks with minimal effort. Further I’ll also describe the gear I use in order to make this work.</p>

     <p>Having founded the entire Droidcon franchise in 2009, Droidcon Berlin is a magical conference to be at. Not only do they have an awesome lineup of speakers (including yours truly). But they also organize great after hour events. Further they’re the first conference ever where I didn’t have any Wi-Fi issues (looking at you #io16).</p>

<p>As there were four different tracks, it was obviously not possible to attend every session. But I did notice some general themes and would like to share my personal highlights with you.</p>

   <title>Efficiently reducing your method count</title>

     <p>As green field projects are a rare breed, chances are that you’ve inherited a legacy code base. If you’re as lucky as me, that code base has over 65k methods causing the build times to be boringly slow.</p>

<p>Today I would like to show how you can visualize your current method count and understand what libraries are eating up the largest part of that. Next it’s time to reduce said method count and remove that nasty multidex solution once and for all.</p>

<p>With over 770 attendees and four different tracks, it was obviously not possible to attend every session. But I did notice some general themes and would like to share my personal highlights with you.</p>

   <title>A successful XML naming convention</title>
   <link href="https://jeroenmols.com/blog/2016/03/07/resourcenaming/"/>

     <p>Do you remember the last time you had to dig into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">strings.xml</code> to find the right String to use? Or that you manually had to go over all drawables to find the one you needed?</p>

<p>Whenever we start a new project, we take a lot of care in setting up our architecture, CI, build flavors,… But do you also have a strategy to name your resources?</p>

<p>You should! Because the lack of XML namespaces, makes managing Android resources tedious. And causes things to grow out of control easily, especially in large projects.</p>

<p>So let’s introduce a simple scheme that will solve your pains.</p>

<ul>
  <li>easy lookup of any resource (autocomplete)</li>
  <li>logical, predictable names</li>
  <li>clean ordering of resources</li>
  <li>strongly typed resources</li>
</ul>

<p>This blogpost will explain the mechanism, its advantages, limitations and provide an easy to use cheat sheet.</p>

   <title>Git as a secure private Maven repository</title>
   <link href="https://jeroenmols.com/blog/2016/02/05/wagongit/"/>

     <p>As my previous blogposts already covered how to set up a private Maven repository, you might wonder “Why again a Maven blogpost?”. Well that’s a fair question and the answer is twofold:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Backup mechanism, to ensure you never ever loose releases.</li>
  <li>Remote access outside of your local network (intranet).</li>
</ol>

<p>And Git implicitly solves both! :)</p>

<p>I’ll demonstrate how to configure Bitbucket as a free private remote Maven repository and automate everything in one simple Gradle script.</p>

   <title>Year in review 2015</title>
   <link href="https://jeroenmols.com/blog/2016/01/29/yearinreview/"/>

     <p>Finally found the time to write my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">year in review</code>. #insomnia</p>

<p>2015 was a huge year for me! I even dare to say the biggest one of my life so far as I became a father of a lovely daughter Lene. Its really hard to over state how big of an impact that has on your life and how fantastic it is to see your own baby grow (and recognize parts of yourself in her). This obviously also explains my late <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">year in review</code> post. #perfectexcuse</p>

<p>On a technical level I also fared well and I’m very happy with what I’ve been able to accomplish:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Created an library with &gt;500 stars on  <a href="https://github.com/JeroenMols/LandscapeVideoCamera">Github</a></li>
  <li>Started my own blog and <a href="http://jeroenmols.com">website</a></li>
  <li>Featured blogpost in <a href="http://androidweekly.net/issues/issue-165">Android Weekly</a></li>
  <li>Spoke at my first conference <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jeroenmols/distributing-to-a-public-or-private-maven-repository">Droidcon Paris</a></li>
  <li>Actively started using <a href="https://twitter.com/molsjeroen">twitter</a> and gained &gt;100 followers</li>
  <li>Gained &gt;1000 reputation on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/2771851/jmols">stackoverflow</a></li>
  <li>Landed a new job at Philips Hue</li>
  <li>Learned Xamarin and built a cross platform app</li>
  <li>Wrote the worlds latest <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">year in review</code> post</li>
</ul>

<p>Next year will be more challenging as my daughter has become a lot more effective at grabbing my attention than my laptop. However I want to increase my efforts contributing back to the community by speaking at more conferences and writing more blogposts. Finally I also want to visit Google IO, which is about time I got there, don’t you agree? ;)</p>

   <title>Level up GitHub builds with CI and code coverage</title>

     <p>Wouldn’t you love to have your open source projects built automatically by a continuous integration server? And to have a detailed code coverage report for all your unit tests? Even when someone generated a pull request? And how about having cool badges to show off all of this?</p>

<p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/JeroenMols/LandscapeVideoCamera"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/JeroenMols/LandscapeVideoCamera.svg?branch=master" alt="Build Status" /></a>    <a href="https://coveralls.io/github/JeroenMols/LandscapeVideoCamera?branch=master"><img src="https://coveralls.io/repos/JeroenMols/LandscapeVideoCamera/badge.svg?branch=master&amp;service=github" alt="Coverage Status" /></a></p>

<p>Actually, all of this a breeze to set up, once you understand what works and what doesn’t. It is even completely free for open source projects!</p>

<p>In less than half an hour, this blogpost will add CI and code coverage to your projects, just like I did for my own library <a href="https://github.com/JeroenMols/LandscapeVideoCamera">LandscapeVideoCamera</a>. While this article focusses on Android, the material presented here can quite easily be extended to a broader scope.</p>

     <p>My previous <a href="/blog/2015/08/06/artifactory/">blog post</a> described how to set up your own private Maven repository with Artifactory in 30 minutes. This second and final part will make things more interesting and take your setup to the next level.</p>

<p>You will learn how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>handle library projects with dependencies</li>
  <li>securely provide username and password</li>
  <li>work with snapshot and release builds</li>
  <li>configure custom repositories</li>
  <li>manage user access</li>
</ul>

<p>All source code is <a href="https://github.com/JeroenMols/ArtifactoryExample">available on Github</a> as usual.</p>

     <p>Setting up your own Maven repository and uploading artifacts to it is quite a daunting task. As I went through this experience myself recently, I want to help others in setting up their own Maven repository via <a href="http://www.jfrog.com/open-source/">Artifactory</a> and automate uploading artifacts using Gradle.</p>

<p>In less than 30 minutes you will have a fully operational private Maven repository and have configured your Gradle buildscripts to upload your Android library artifacts.</p>

<p>Note that the material presented here can quite easily be extended to be applicable in a broader scope beyond Android.</p>

     <p>For quite some months, I’ve been planning to create a website and start blogging about the things I’m passionate about. Last week, I finally decided to setup a <a href="http://jeroenmols.github.io">portfolio</a> and <a href="http://jeroen.mols.github.io/blog">blog</a> using GitHub pages and Jekyll.</p>

<p>Since I’m an Android and not a web developer, the first blogging subject wasn’t hard to find: challenges I came across in setting up this website and blog.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Eventually I had to use a workaround - that’s why I don’t build websites professionally - but I strongly believe in a <em>Just do It</em> mentality and then learn/improve as you go.</p>
