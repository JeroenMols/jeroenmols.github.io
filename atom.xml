     <p>This isn’t another post about the benefits of using Kotlin. Hell, I’m not even going to cover any of its language features. Nor will I try to convince you to make the switch.</p>

<p>In contrast, this post will talk career. How learning a new language makes you a better developer and ensures you stay relevant. And in that regards, Kotlin now presents a golden opportunity.</p>

     <p>For years Android developers have been limited to Java 6 features. While RetroLambda or the experimental Jack toolchain would help, proper support from Google was notably missing.</p>

<p>Finally, Android Studio 3.0 brings (backported!) support for most Java 8 features. Continue reading to learn how those work and why you should upgrade.</p>

   <title>Year in review 2016</title>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[
     
     <p>It’s that time of the year again to do a little personal retrospective.</p>

<p>2016 passed by so quickly! I had a fantastic time playing around with (and taking care of) my wife and daughter. It’s really astonishing to see how much a baby can learn and grow in a year.</p>

<p>Being a father also helps putting things into perspective and rediscover the little pleasures in live. For example, there is literally no better cure for stress than coming home, being greeted by a happy smile and laying down on the floor playing with your own kid. :)</p>

<p>Besides that, I actually found more time than expected to grow technically. As such I:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wrote <a href="http://jeroenmols.com/blog/">11 blogposts</a>, almost meeting my goal of 1 per month</li>
  <li>Got featured in <a href="http://androidweekly.net/search?keyword=jeroen+mols&amp;commit=Search">Android weekly</a> a whopping 9 times</li>
  <li>Appeared on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxFaWXkBo2E">Android dialogs</a></li>
  <li>Spoke at 5 big conferences + 1 local meetup</li>
  <li>Grew my <a href="https://twitter.com/molsjeroen">twitter</a> followers to more than 750</li>
  <li>Gathered over 1000 stars on <a href="http://github-awards.com/users/search?login=jeroenmols">Github</a></li>
  <li>Gained &gt;2000 reputation on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/2771851/jmols">stackoverflow</a></li>
  <li>Built a new Github library <a href="https://github.com/JeroenMols/MockitoCollectionMatchers">MockitoCollectionMatchers</a></li>
  <li>Visited Google IO (finally!)</li>
  <li>Built 2 green field side projects!</li>
  <li>Made plans for building a house</li>
  <li>Taught my daughter how to fist bump and say Yolo #awesomedad</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://jeroenmols.com/img/blog/yearinreview16/house.png" alt="Render of our house" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>Next year construction of our dream house will start, so time will once again be a scarce resource. And since I don’t want to give in on quality time with my daughter, I’ll just try to keep up my current blogging and speaking efforts. However, it would be really cool if I could speak at a conference outside Europe!</p>

     <p>Cycling is all about exploring: visiting new places and making existing routes more fun with better streets. So there must be an app that allows to plan your route and start cycling right? Think again… there is currently no solution that offers turn by turn navigation for cyclists.</p>

<p>As I had an old Android device laying around, I decided to repurpose that and convert it into a GPS that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tracks my activity</li>
  <li>imports gpx tracks created on my computer</li>
  <li>offers turn by turn navigation (screen + voice)</li>
</ul>

<p>This blogpost will detail how I use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand">OsmAnd</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.dropsync">Dropsync</a> to create new tracks with minimal effort. Further I’ll also describe the gear I use in order to make this work.</p>

     <p>As green field projects are a rare breed, chances are that you’ve inherited a legacy code base. If you’re as lucky as me, that code base has over 65k methods causing the build times to be boringly slow.</p>

<p>Today I would like to show how you can visualize your current method count and understand what libraries are eating up the largest part of that. Next it’s time to reduce said method count and remove that nasty multidex solution once and for all.</p>

     <p>Do you remember the last time you had to dig into <code class="highlighter-rouge">strings.xml</code> to find the right String to use? Or that you manually had to go over all drawables to find the one you needed?</p>

<p>Whenever we start a new project, we take a lot of care in setting up our architecture, CI, build flavors,… But do you also have a strategy to name your resources?</p>

<p>You should! Because the lack of XML namespaces, makes managing Android resources tedious. And causes things to grow out of control easily, especially in large projects.</p>

<p>So let’s introduce a simple scheme that will solve your pains.</p>

<ul>
  <li>easy lookup of any resource (autocomplete)</li>
  <li>logical, predictable names</li>
  <li>clean ordering of resources</li>
  <li>strongly typed resources</li>
</ul>

<p>This blogpost will explain the mechanism, its advantages, limitations and provide an easy to use cheat sheet.</p>

     <p>As my previous blogposts already covered how to set up a private Maven repository, you might wonder “Why again a Maven blogpost?”. Well that’s a fair question and the answer is twofold:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Backup mechanism, to ensure you never ever loose releases.</li>
  <li>Remote access outside of your local network (intranet).</li>
</ol>

<p>And Git implicitly solves both! :)</p>

<p>I’ll demonstrate how to configure Bitbucket as a free private remote Maven repository and automate everything in one simple Gradle script.</p>

     <p>Finally found the time to write my <code class="highlighter-rouge">year in review</code>. #insomnia</p>

<p>2015 was a huge year for me! I even dare to say the biggest one of my life so far as I became a father of a lovely daughter Lene. Its really hard to over state how big of an impact that has on your life and how fantastic it is to see your own baby grow (and recognize parts of yourself in her). This obviously also explains my late <code class="highlighter-rouge">year in review</code> post. #perfectexcuse</p>

<p>On a technical level I also fared well and I’m very happy with what I’ve been able to accomplish:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Created an library with &gt;500 stars on  <a href="https://github.com/JeroenMols/LandscapeVideoCamera">Github</a></li>
  <li>Started my own blog and <a href="http://jeroenmols.com">website</a></li>
  <li>Featured blogpost in <a href="http://androidweekly.net/issues/issue-165">Android Weekly</a></li>
  <li>Spoke at my first conference <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jeroenmols/distributing-to-a-public-or-private-maven-repository">Droidcon Paris</a></li>
  <li>Actively started using <a href="https://twitter.com/molsjeroen">twitter</a> and gained &gt;100 followers</li>
  <li>Gained &gt;1000 reputation on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/2771851/jmols">stackoverflow</a></li>
  <li>Landed a new job at Philips Hue</li>
  <li>Learned Xamarin and built a cross platform app</li>
  <li>Wrote the worlds latest <code class="highlighter-rouge">year in review</code> post</li>
</ul>

<p>Next year will be more challenging as my daughter has become a lot more effective at grabbing my attention than my laptop. However I want to increase my efforts contributing back to the community by speaking at more conferences and writing more blogposts. Finally I also want to visit Google IO, which is about time I got there, don’t you agree? ;)</p>

     <p>Wouldn’t you love to have your open source projects built automatically by a continuous integration server? And to have a detailed code coverage report for all your unit tests? Even when someone generated a pull request? And how about having cool badges to show off all of this?</p>

<p>Actually, all of this a breeze to set up, once you understand what works and what doesn’t. It is even completely free for open source projects!</p>

<p>In less than half an hour, this blogpost will add CI and code coverage to your projects, just like I did for my own library <a href="https://github.com/JeroenMols/LandscapeVideoCamera">LandscapeVideoCamera</a>. While this article focusses on Android, the material presented here can quite easily be extended to a broader scope.</p>

     <p>My previous <a href="/blog/2015/08/06/artifactory/">blog post</a> described how to set up your own private Maven repository with Artifactory in 30 minutes. This second and final part will make things more interesting and take your setup to the next level.</p>

<p>You will learn how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>handle library projects with dependencies</li>
  <li>securely provide username and password</li>
  <li>work with snapshot and release builds</li>
  <li>configure custom repositories</li>
  <li>manage user access</li>
</ul>

<p>All source code is <a href="https://github.com/JeroenMols/ArtifactoryExample">available on Github</a> as usual.</p>

<p>Note that the material presented here can quite easily be extended to be applicable beyond Android.</p>

     <p>Setting up your own Maven repository and uploading artifacts to it is quite a daunting task. As I went through this experience myself recently, I want to help others in setting up their own Maven repository via <a href="http://www.jfrog.com/open-source/">Artifactory</a> and automate uploading artifacts using Gradle.</p>

<p>In less than 30 minutes you will have a fully operational private Maven repository and have configured your Gradle buildscripts to upload your Android library artifacts.</p>

<p>Note that the material presented here can quite easily be extended to be applicable in a broader scope beyond Android.</p>

   <title>How I created my blog</title>
   <link href="https://jeroenmols.com/blog/2015/04/25/blog-creation/"/>

     <p>For quite some months, I’ve been planning to create a website and start blogging about the things I’m passionate about. Last week, I finally decided to setup a <a href="http://jeroenmols.github.io">portfolio</a> and <a href="http://jeroen.mols.github.io/blog">blog</a> using GitHub pages and Jekyll.</p>

<p>Since I’m an Android and not a web developer, the first blogging subject wasn’t hard to find: challenges I came across in setting up this website and blog.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Eventually I had to use a workaround - that’s why I don’t build websites professionally - but I strongly believe in a <em>Just do It</em> mentality and then learn/improve as you go.</p>
