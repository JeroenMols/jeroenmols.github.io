     <p>Now that we have a clear idea of how a modularized app could look like how can this be applied to an existing app?</p>

<p>Part four will dive deeper into how existing apps can be sliced and how you can gradually migrate to a fully modularized architecture.</p>

     <p>With a clear view on how multi-module apps should be architected, let’s dive into a real-life practical example.</p>

<p>We’ll discover how the architecture results in a clear application structure, how navigation is handled, how to use staged rollouts, how to test everything and even look at a production app that is using this architecture.</p>

     <p>Now that we’ve established that modularization is a really good thing to strive for, how should a modularized app look like? How are the different modules connected? And how does this look for a real app?</p>

<p>This second part will explore a simple, yet very effective approach to modularizing apps. It will cover in depth the different kinds of modules and present the benefits of this approach.</p>

   <title>Year in review 2018</title>
   <link href="https://jeroenmols.com/blog/2019/01/01/yearinreview/"/>
   <updated>2019-01-01T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>https://jeroenmols.com/blog/2019/01/01/yearinreview</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[
     
     <p>Sitting in our own couch, in our own house, kids safely asleep upstairs,… The road here was brutal, but the result is extraordinary.</p>

<p>The past year was (hopefully) the busiest year of my entire life. In the midst of raising two amazing kids, a challenging full-time job and being an active GDE, we built our dream house!</p>

<p>Looking back I honestly don’t know how we managed to pull all of this off… Choosing everything for the house, selecting and planning all contractors and even doing some (a lot more than anticipated) work myself… Anyways, I won’t bother you with the details, but if not for my wife and kids I would have broken down completely. The goal justifies the means.</p>

<p>Also at work, it was a non-trivial and very demanding year. I used to pride myself for being great at keeping a work-life balance, but… being a responsible for a team of people can really be quite intense.</p>

<p>Our team had quite some challenges thrown at us, and we really made the best of it: sometimes massively successful, but we also struggled… All in all, we did get a tight grip on our regression, laid the groundwork to improve our architecture and migrated to continuous deployment. (talk coming 2019 ;) )</p>

<p>In 2018, I/we mostly invested in our family’s future and:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Built and moved into our dream house</li>
  <li>Helped our daughter go to school and taught our son how to walk</li>
  <li>Spoke at <a href="https://jeroenmols.com/speaking/">4 big conferences</a> and 1 meetup.</li>
  <li>Wrote <a href="http://jeroenmols.com/blog/">9 blog posts</a>, not making my goal of 1 per month</li>
  <li>Almost double my <a href="https://twitter.com/molsjeroen">Twitter</a> followers to more than 3620</li>
  <li>Got 6 times featured in <a href="http://androidweekly.net/search?keyword=jeroen+mols&amp;commit=Search">Android weekly</a> and several times in <a href="http://mailchi.mp/kotlinweekly/kotlin-weekly-118">Kotlin weekly</a></li>
  <li>Exclusively used Kotlin for every blog post and slide deck</li>
  <li>Helped Pluralsight built a <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/score/skill-assessment/kotlin-app-fundamentals/intro?context=skills#/v2/landing">Kotlin: App Fundamentals</a> assessment</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://jeroenmols.com/img/blog/yearinreview18/christmas_tree.jpg" alt="Garden view" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>Looking forward to next year, I’m planning on living more! I’ve bought quite a few Lego’s I’d like to build, want to bring my kids to school by bike, spend more quality time with my wife and just professionally waste time on occasion. :)</p>

<p>I’m going to try and increase my community efforts back to 2017 level and maybe experiment with some new formats, such as <a href="https://jeroenmols.com/blog/2018/12/06/fixthetest/">my last blog post</a>.</p>

     <p>Refactoring can be tedious and easily introduce bugs. The main reason for this is the number of manual steps involved: rename, move, copy-paste,… So wouldn’t it make sense to automate this and have Android Studio do all the work for you?</p>

<p>This post will zoom in on the most useful refactoring options of Android Studio. Enabling you to refactor more confidently, introduce fewer bugs and increase overall quality as also variables, documentation, etc. will be updated.</p>

   <title>Year in review 2017</title>
   <link href="https://jeroenmols.com/blog/2018/01/01/yearinreview/"/>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[
     
     <p>For the first time ever I have my <code class="highlighter-rouge">year in review</code> ready in time.</p>

<p>I’m sure I’ll never forget 2017. Not only did we start building our dream house, but more importantly, our family grew to 4 people! Our baby girl Lene - ahum Toddler - became the big sister of our newborn son Wout. While having two kids is definitely very, very intense, it’s extraordinary to see them grow and a privilege to experience how fond they already are of each other.</p>

<p>For my career this was the most remarkable year so far as I:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Became a <a href="https://developers.google.com/experts/people/jeroen-mols">Google Developer Expert for Android</a></li>
  <li>Built up an internal app team and became the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6264882628466475008">Lead Android developer</a> at Philips Hue</li>
  <li>Started my own company <a href="https://jeroenmols.com/hireme/">Build IT bvba</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Further, I’m super proud of all my community efforts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spoke at <a href="https://jeroenmols.com/speaking/">4 big conferences + 5 local meetups</a></li>
  <li>Wrote <a href="http://jeroenmols.com/blog/">13 blog posts</a>, exceeding my goal of 1 per month</li>
  <li>Grew my <a href="https://twitter.com/molsjeroen">Twitter</a> followers to more than 1850</li>
  <li>Had the <a href="https://medium.com/@jordanjoz/12-android-blogs-you-should-be-following-1220c7e5398d">12th most influential Android blog</a> in the world</li>
  <li>Got 5 times featured in <a href="http://androidweekly.net/search?keyword=jeroen+mols&amp;commit=Search">Android weekly</a> and once in <a href="http://mailchi.mp/kotlinweekly/kotlin-weekly-59">Kotlin weekly</a></li>
  <li>Gave the <a href="https://devoxx.be/2017/11/the-top-100-rated-devoxx-belgium-2017-talks/">8th highest rated talk</a> at Devoxx</li>
  <li>Revamped <a href="https://jeroenmols.com/">my website</a> with https, faster loading, and search</li>

<p>But leave no mistake, my family is and will always be the most important thing in the world!</p>

<p>Looking forward to next year, stuff is going to be intense for sure! We’ll complete the construction of our house, our daughter will start going to school, our son will likely learn how to walk,… and I don’t want to miss a second of all that. Which means #latenightblogging. :)</p>

<p>So I’m not going to increase my community efforts, but instead, I’d like to experiment with data analytics to increase the impact of all my typical efforts.</p>

     <p>It’s that time of the year again to do a little personal retrospective.</p>

<p>2016 passed by so quickly! I had a fantastic time playing around with (and taking care of) my wife and daughter. It’s really astonishing to see how much a baby can learn and grow in a year.</p>

<p>Being a father also helps putting things into perspective and rediscover the little pleasures in live. For example, there is literally no better cure for stress than coming home, being greeted by a happy smile and laying down on the floor playing with your own kid. :)</p>

<p>Besides that, I actually found more time than expected to grow technically. As such I:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wrote <a href="http://jeroenmols.com/blog/">11 blogposts</a>, almost meeting my goal of 1 per month</li>
  <li>Got featured in <a href="http://androidweekly.net/search?keyword=jeroen+mols&amp;commit=Search">Android weekly</a> a whopping 9 times</li>
  <li>Appeared on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxFaWXkBo2E">Android dialogs</a></li>
  <li>Spoke at 5 big conferences + 1 local meetup</li>
  <li>Grew my <a href="https://twitter.com/molsjeroen">twitter</a> followers to more than 750</li>
  <li>Gathered over 1000 stars on <a href="http://github-awards.com/users/search?login=jeroenmols">Github</a></li>
  <li>Gained &gt;2000 reputation on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/2771851/jmols">stackoverflow</a></li>
  <li>Built a new Github library <a href="https://github.com/JeroenMols/MockitoCollectionMatchers">MockitoCollectionMatchers</a></li>
  <li>Visited Google IO (finally!)</li>
  <li>Built 2 green field side projects!</li>
  <li>Made plans for building a house</li>
  <li>Taught my daughter how to fist bump and say Yolo #awesomedad</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://jeroenmols.com/img/blog/yearinreview16/house.png" alt="Render of our house" class="align-center" /></p>

<p>Next year construction of our dream house will start, so time will once again be a scarce resource. And since I don’t want to give in on quality time with my daughter, I’ll just try to keep up my current blogging and speaking efforts. However, it would be really cool if I could speak at a conference outside Europe!</p>

     <p>Cycling is all about exploring: visiting new places and making existing routes more fun with better streets. So there must be an app that allows to plan your route and start cycling right? Think again… there is currently no solution that offers turn by turn navigation for cyclists.</p>

<ul>
  <li>tracks my activity</li>
  <li>imports gpx tracks created on my computer</li>
  <li>offers turn by turn navigation (screen + voice)</li>

<p>Today I would like to show how you can visualize your current method count and understand what libraries are eating up the largest part of that. Next it’s time to reduce said method count and remove that nasty multidex solution once and for all.</p>

     <p>Do you remember the last time you had to dig into <code class="highlighter-rouge">strings.xml</code> to find the right String to use? Or that you manually had to go over all drawables to find the one you needed?</p>

<p>Whenever we start a new project, we take a lot of care in setting up our architecture, CI, build flavors,… But do you also have a strategy to name your resources?</p>

<p>You should! Because the lack of XML namespaces, makes managing Android resources tedious. And causes things to grow out of control easily, especially in large projects.</p>

<p>So let’s introduce a simple scheme that will solve your pains.</p>

<ul>
  <li>easy lookup of any resource (autocomplete)</li>
  <li>logical, predictable names</li>
  <li>clean ordering of resources</li>
  <li>strongly typed resources</li>
</ul>

<p>This blogpost will explain the mechanism, its advantages, limitations and provide an easy to use cheat sheet.</p>

     <p>As my previous blogposts already covered how to set up a private Maven repository, you might wonder “Why again a Maven blogpost?”. Well that’s a fair question and the answer is twofold:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Backup mechanism, to ensure you never ever loose releases.</li>
  <li>Remote access outside of your local network (intranet).</li>
</ol>

<p>And Git implicitly solves both! :)</p>

<p>I’ll demonstrate how to configure Bitbucket as a free private remote Maven repository and automate everything in one simple Gradle script.</p>

     <p>Finally found the time to write my <code class="highlighter-rouge">year in review</code>. #insomnia</p>

<p>2015 was a huge year for me! I even dare to say the biggest one of my life so far as I became a father of a lovely daughter Lene. Its really hard to over state how big of an impact that has on your life and how fantastic it is to see your own baby grow (and recognize parts of yourself in her). This obviously also explains my late <code class="highlighter-rouge">year in review</code> post. #perfectexcuse</p>

<p>On a technical level I also fared well and I’m very happy with what I’ve been able to accomplish:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Created an library with &gt;500 stars on  <a href="https://github.com/JeroenMols/LandscapeVideoCamera">Github</a></li>
  <li>Started my own blog and <a href="http://jeroenmols.com">website</a></li>
  <li>Featured blogpost in <a href="http://androidweekly.net/issues/issue-165">Android Weekly</a></li>
  <li>Spoke at my first conference <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jeroenmols/distributing-to-a-public-or-private-maven-repository">Droidcon Paris</a></li>
  <li>Actively started using <a href="https://twitter.com/molsjeroen">twitter</a> and gained &gt;100 followers</li>
  <li>Gained &gt;1000 reputation on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/2771851/jmols">stackoverflow</a></li>
  <li>Landed a new job at Philips Hue</li>
  <li>Learned Xamarin and built a cross platform app</li>
  <li>Wrote the worlds latest <code class="highlighter-rouge">year in review</code> post</li>
</ul>

<p>Next year will be more challenging as my daughter has become a lot more effective at grabbing my attention than my laptop. However I want to increase my efforts contributing back to the community by speaking at more conferences and writing more blogposts. Finally I also want to visit Google IO, which is about time I got there, don’t you agree? ;)</p>

   <title>Level up GitHub builds with CI and code coverage</title>
   <link href="https://jeroenmols.com/blog/2015/11/13/traviscoveralls/"/>

     <p>Wouldn’t you love to have your open source projects built automatically by a continuous integration server? And to have a detailed code coverage report for all your unit tests? Even when someone generated a pull request? And how about having cool badges to show off all of this?</p>

<p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/JeroenMols/LandscapeVideoCamera"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/JeroenMols/LandscapeVideoCamera.svg?branch=master" alt="Build Status" /></a>    <a href="https://coveralls.io/github/JeroenMols/LandscapeVideoCamera?branch=master"><img src="https://coveralls.io/repos/JeroenMols/LandscapeVideoCamera/badge.svg?branch=master&amp;service=github" alt="Coverage Status" /></a></p>

<p>Actually, all of this a breeze to set up, once you understand what works and what doesn’t. It is even completely free for open source projects!</p>

<p>In less than half an hour, this blogpost will add CI and code coverage to your projects, just like I did for my own library <a href="https://github.com/JeroenMols/LandscapeVideoCamera">LandscapeVideoCamera</a>. While this article focusses on Android, the material presented here can quite easily be extended to a broader scope.</p>

   <title>Getting the most out of Artifactory</title>
   <link href="https://jeroenmols.com/blog/2015/08/13/artifactory2/"/>

     <p>My previous <a href="/blog/2015/08/06/artifactory/">blog post</a> described how to set up your own private Maven repository with Artifactory in 30 minutes. This second and final part will make things more interesting and take your setup to the next level.</p>

<p>You will learn how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>handle library projects with dependencies</li>
  <li>securely provide username and password</li>
  <li>work with snapshot and release builds</li>
  <li>configure custom repositories</li>
  <li>manage user access</li>
</ul>

<p>All source code is <a href="https://github.com/JeroenMols/ArtifactoryExample">available on Github</a> as usual.</p>

<p>Note that the material presented here can quite easily be extended to be applicable beyond Android.</p>

   <title>A private Maven repository for Android in 30 min</title>
   <link href="https://jeroenmols.com/blog/2015/08/06/artifactory/"/>

     <p>Setting up your own Maven repository and uploading artifacts to it is quite a daunting task. As I went through this experience myself recently, I want to help others in setting up their own Maven repository via <a href="http://www.jfrog.com/open-source/">Artifactory</a> and automate uploading artifacts using Gradle.</p>

<p>In less than 30 minutes you will have a fully operational private Maven repository and have configured your Gradle buildscripts to upload your Android library artifacts.</p>

<p>Note that the material presented here can quite easily be extended to be applicable in a broader scope beyond Android.</p>

   <title>How I created my blog</title>
   <link href="https://jeroenmols.com/blog/2015/04/25/blog-creation/"/>

     <p>For quite some months, I’ve been planning to create a website and start blogging about the things I’m passionate about. Last week, I finally decided to setup a <a href="http://jeroenmols.github.io">portfolio</a> and <a href="http://jeroen.mols.github.io/blog">blog</a> using GitHub pages and Jekyll.</p>

<p>Since I’m an Android and not a web developer, the first blogging subject wasn’t hard to find: challenges I came across in setting up this website and blog.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Eventually I had to use a workaround - that’s why I don’t build websites professionally - but I strongly believe in a <em>Just do It</em> mentality and then learn/improve as you go.</p>
