Struggling to navigate your code? There must be a better way than just search everywhere, no? How do you investigate relations between different classes? Let's learn how to navigate code in Android Studio like a pro.

Being a skillful Android developer means getting the most out of the tools at your disposal. This series will give you practical examples on how you can better navigate and refactor code.

## TL;DR
// TODO

## Code manipulation
duplicate line
move line of code up/down
move block of code up/down
delete line

## Refactoring
shift F6 -> rename
cmd F6 -> change signature
F6 -> move

alt cmd N -> inline
alt cmd V -> extract variable
alt cmd F -> extract field
alt cmd C -> extract constant
alt cmd P -> extract parameter

more advanced options: have a look in the menu

## Leverage Android Studio
alt enter on if statements (and other examples)

## Wrap up
