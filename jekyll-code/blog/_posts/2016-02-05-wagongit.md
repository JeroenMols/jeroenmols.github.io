As my previous blogposts already covered how to set up a private Maven repository, you might wonder "Why again a Maven blogpost?". Well that's a fair question and the answer is twofold:

1. Backup mechanism, to ensure you never ever loose releases.
2. Remote access outside of your local network (intranet).

And Git implicitly solves both! :)

I'll demonstrate how to configure Bitbucket as a free private remote Maven repository and automate everything in one simple Gradle script.

## Preface
While you could use any Git repository (like GitHub), I choose Bitbucket as it offers [free private repositories](https://bitbucket.org/product/pricing) for small teams. Furthermore it has an API which we will need for some of the wizardry later on.

All source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/JeroenMols/WagonGitExample) and can be used after some minor BitBucket configuration. You can find the [Gradle script](https://github.com/JeroenMols/GitAsMaven) in a separate repository.

## Bitbucket
Without any further a do, lets get to it and start configuring BitBucket.

Login to Bitbucket and create a new private repository called `maven_repository`.

[![Create new BitBucket repository]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/blog/wagongit/createrepository.png){: .align-center}]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/blog/wagongit/createrepository.png)

Checkout the repository locally, create a `README.md` file and commit that file to your local branch. Now push that branch to BitBucket, BUT make sure to push it to a remote branch called "releases". (this is key, as the plugin we'll use later on depends on this)

[![BitBucket repository with main branch releases.]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/blog/wagongit/releasebranch.png){: .align-center}]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/blog/wagongit/releasebranch.png)

> **Troubleshooting releases branch**
> If you accidentally push your local branch to a remote called `master`, create a new branch locally called releases, push that to a remote `releases` and change your main branch in the BitBucket settings for that repository.

> You can safely remove origin/master if you want.

## Wagon-git
To upload Maven artifacts to a Git repository, we will use a Maven plugin called [Wagon-git](https://synergian.github.io/wagon-git/), which can hook into the existing Gradle DSL for Maven uploads.

Simply add a new repository:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url "https://raw.github.com/synergian/wagon-git/releases" }
}
```

And configure Maven like you would normally do, but with our BitBucket repository url in a particular format:

```groovy
uploadArchives {
    repositories.mavenDeployer {
        ...
        repository(url: 'git:releases://git@bitbucket.org:' + COMPANY + '/' + REPOSITORY_NAME + '.git')
        ...
    }
}
```

Where `COMPANY` is the name of your BitBucket organization and `REPOSITORY_NAME` is `maven_repository`.

Now you can simply create a new release by running the following command:

```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease uploadArchives
```

And check BitBucket for the resulting artifacts.

[![Release commit of a Maven upload to BitBucket.]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/blog/wagongit/releasecommits.png){: .align-center}]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/img/blog/wagongit/releasecommits.png)

## Unique versions only
As Git naturally allows you to override existing files, we will need to do something to prevent this from happening. Otherwise, you could have a v1.1.3 library, which is stable one day and full of bugs the next (because someone replaced it in the Maven repo). Not exactly what you want, right?

We will use the BitBucket API to verify if a particular release already exists:

```groovy
task lookForArtifacts {
    doLast {
        ...
        def repositoryUrl = 'https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0/repositories/' + COMPANY + '/' + REPOSITORY_NAME + '/raw/releases/' + artifactPath
        ...
        if (urlExists(repositoryUrl)) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Artifact with version " + ARTIFACT_VERSION + " already exist - not executing uploadArchives")
        }
        return true
    }
}
```

Quite simple actually: just reverse engineer the url of a particular release artifact and the see if we get a 200 response or not.

Finally we ensure that we always run the previous task before running the Maven task:

```groovy
uploadArchives.dependsOn lookForArtifacts
```

Running `./gradlew uploadArchives` now successfully creates a release.

## Consuming artifacts
Add your Maven repository to the list of repositories in your main `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()

        maven {
            credentials {
                username USERNAME
                password PASSWORD
            }
            url "https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0/repositories/jeroenmols/maven_repository/raw/releases"
        }
    }
}
```

Note that we have to provide a `username` and `password` as we are connecting to a private repository.

> **Important**
>
> Make sure not to put your username and password directly into the `build.gradle` file! That would be a major security risk. Instead have a look at [this blogpost](http://jeroenmols.com/blog/2015/08/13/artifactory2/) to learn how to securely provide a username and password.

Now simply add a dependency on your library like you are used to and you're ready.

```groovy
dependencies {
    ...
    compile 'com.jeroenmols.awesomelibrary:awesomelibrary:1.0.0'
}
```

## Putting it all together
To make your life a lot easier, I've created a [Gradle script](https://github.com/JeroenMols/WagonGitExample/blob/master/library/publish-bitbucket.gradle) that does everything for you.

Setting up your project is easy:

1. Add the following plugin to the top of the [build.gradle](https://github.com/JeroenMols/WagonGitExample/blob/master/library/build.gradle) file in your library folder

  ```groovy
  apply from: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JeroenMols/GitAsMaven/master/publish-bitbucket.gradle'
  ```

2. Create a [gradle.properties](https://github.com/JeroenMols/WagonGitExample/blob/master/library/gradle.properties) file within your library folder with the following parameters:

  ```groovy
  ARTIFACT_VERSION=<version_here>
  ARTIFACT_NAME=<libraryname_here>
  ARTIFACT_PACKAGE=<packagename_here>
  ARTIFACT_PACKAGING=aar //You could also use jar

  COMPANY=<bitbucket_team_company_here> //Username if not part of team
  REPOSITORY_NAME=<bitbucket_reponame_here>
  ```

3. Create a [gradle.properties](https://github.com/JeroenMols/WagonGitExample/blob/master/gradle.properties) file in the root of your project (or better in the global `.gradle` folder on your system) with the following parameters

  ```groovy
  USERNAME=<username_here>
  PASSWORD=<password_here>
  ```

4. Run the following command to upload a version to your Maven repository.

  ```bash
  ./gradlew uploadArchives
  ```

Thats's it!

## Wrap-up
Configuring BitBucket or GitHub as a (private) Maven repository is quite easy and can be fully automated in a single Gradle script. Hopefully this blogpost has inspired many of you to start reusing more code.

A basic example project with everything in this blogpost integrated is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/JeroenMols/WagonGitExample). Or you can also directly integrate the [Gradle script](https://github.com/JeroenMols/GitAsMaven) into your library.
