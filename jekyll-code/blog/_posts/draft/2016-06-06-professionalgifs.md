Making your App of Github library stand out from the crowd is not such an easy thing. Key to success is creating an attractive landing page were user can instantly see the added value of your work.

While you could spent a lot of time and effort in creating a good description, why don't you make a GIF instead? It doesn't just look professional, but it's also visually attractive and understandable by everyone regardless of your language. This blogpost will show you how I drove engagement to my library, LandscapeVideoCamera and how I created an awesomely looking GIF.
