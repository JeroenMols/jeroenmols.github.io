Was really great visiting Kotlinconf this year and I wanted to do a quick post to link to all of it's wonderful content.

## Conference slides
While you will be able to find all recordings [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ176FUIyIUbVvFMqDc2jhxS-t562uytr), I often find it useful to be able to quickly scan through the slides. Hence I bundled everything I could already find from socials.
