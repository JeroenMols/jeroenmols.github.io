Had a blast visiting Droidcon UK this year and wanted to do a quick post to link to all of it's wonderful content.

While you can find all recordings [here](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/8265-droidcon-london-2017#skillscasts), I often find it useful to be able to quickly scan through the slides. Hence I bundled everything I could already from socials.
